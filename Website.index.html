        <h2>Plus sur moi</h2>
        <p>
            Click on the text with the a underlining too follow up on links that i attached too the text
            My name is Jacob Hmaiddout, i was born in Trois-Rivière in June of 2000. My dad was moroccan who came and establish himself in Canada in the late 90's and my mother's from Quebec and Trois-Rivère thoo.
            I love football (I'm a big 49ers fan since i'm 9yo and obviously a big hater of the Seahawks and Cowboys). I live at my terminal most of the time because I love technology.talking about my love for technologies,
            i've become with time a big bitcoin maximalist (maximalist meaning that i'm putting around 10% - 30% of all my paychecks in BTC). I invested in other companies like Palantir, BTO gold Corp et Dynocorp (the latter being A Quebec based company) early on too. I'm a big rap fan and, weirdly enough,
            a big electronic music kinda guy. Kendrick Lamar fan since 2011 when i first heard Section 80. When he dropped Good kid m.A.A.d city, i was so blown away by the quality of the album that i bought it at a time that i use too jailbreak every songs (early 2010's before Apple music and spotify was a thing, Cydia and limewire were the shiiiiit)
            Outside of sports, tech and music, i've always followed politics closely. Being really young in the Arab spring with a moroccan father opened my eyes about the importance of politics. I would consider myself in between being a Liberal and a libetarian. In my books, alot of drugs should not be criminalized, method of payments like CBDC's 
            should not exist. I believe that only minimal state intervention in the free market and the private lives of citizens should be the norm. I think that lobbying should be outlawed in countries like Canada or down south in the US. I'm a big believer in some conspiracy theories like the JFK assasination and 9/11 but not in a typical way. I believe
            that Israel is probably behind those 2 events. 9/11 to justify the Americans too enter Iraq and overthrow Saddam (not justifying his attrocities too*) and Iraq because at the time, Kennedy worried that Israel’s nuclear program was a potentially serious proliferation risk and insisted that Israel permit periodic inspections to mitigate the danger, 
            according to declassified documents published <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2016-04-21/concerned-about-nuclear-weapons-potential-john-f-kennedy">Click here too see it</a> (btw, the article that i just linked literally was released by the NSA after a freedom of information act ). Another fun one that i am pretty sure happened was the murder of Seth Rich. Who's that
            you'll ask me ? Well, he was a 27 year old system adminstrator for the democrat party and got murder in the middle of Washington DC in July of 2016 from gunshots wounds <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Seth_Rich">Seth's wikipedia</A> from the back. DC police classified his murder as a robbery when nothing on his pocession was stolen. Not his watch, not his wallet, nothing. At the same time that his murder unfold, the leaks of the Hillary Clinton 
            were ongoing. Alot of people like me made the link between those 2 events, and not for nothing. I'll link the leaked repport of his autopsy and you'll see that even DC police and the first responder on scene had a feeling that it was a murder politicly related too the DNC, but the investigation got killed by the upper-echelons of the DC police <a href="https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1496023589075.jpg">Seth's autopsy</a> 
            I, myself did contributed at the findings of his last moments while he was walking back home from a bar in DC, i mapped all of the CCTV's camera and uploaded them online and in the thread pinned on my X account, will be linked if you click on the text <a href="https://x.com/Jacob_hmaiddout/status/1678475419593351197" >right now</a> ... i'll link the Imgur database if you can't see it on X, it's were i uploaded them at the time as a backup 
            <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ytAK4">Imagur database</a> .. SO yeah, that's me basically, if you wanna get in touch with me you can easily by clicking one of my social media.
